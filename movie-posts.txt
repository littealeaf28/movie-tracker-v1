Dakota Fanning really was a phenomenal child actor: "War of the Worlds" escape scene
Majority of people find her really irritating in this film.
She’s a good actress though. A better example would be ‘i am sam’ or ‘man on fire’
You should see her in Man On Fire.

Amazing performance.
huh...for me, it was exactly this scene that convinced me she's an annoying over-actor and that the rest of the movie was going to suck (it did)
I love this movie. Hated her in it. I am convinced no kid could be more annoying in an apocalypse situation
*screaming intensifies*
I found her realistically irritating, but to each their own.
Damn, is a 10 year old not allowed to be scared? Lol, I don't know a single ten year old in real life who wouldn't act like her in an apocalypse.
Didn’t say this. Just thought she was annoying.

Havent seen the other two
Its been quite a few years since I’ve seen Dallas Buyers Club but I remember it being excellent. Definitely give it a watch if you can.
My top two would be the same, and then everyone else is just equally forgettable. Not even worth ordering the rest of them.
When it came out my eyes would glaze over whenever they ran across it, but I didn’t know jack about anything then, so it’d be on my radar now.
Yeah, this list was kind of a total drag to throw together. I really do only think highly of the top two as well actually.

But Malek is significantly worse than the rest, I’ll stand by that.
